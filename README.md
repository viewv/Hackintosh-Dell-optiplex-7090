# Hackintosh-Dell-optiplex-7090

Hackintosh OpenCore EFI for Dell optiplex 7080 with 11 Gen i7

I didn't unlock CFG Lock for this EFI, so you should use this EFI fine without unlock the CFG lock.

iGPU can not be used in macOS, so you should use a dGPU. I use RX 5500 XT.

I don't use the WiFi card, so I didn't add the kext for it. You can add it by yourself.  

Test on macOS Sonoma.
